# Test Cache Directory Detection

## Why This Implementation Exists

### Challenge of Project Structure Flexibility
**Problem**: Users may run url2md commands from various subdirectories within their projects, but the cache directory might be located at different levels in the hierarchy, causing cache location failures.
**Solution**: Implemented upward directory traversal algorithm that searches parent directories for valid cache directories, enabling flexible project organization while maintaining cache accessibility.

### Multiple Cache Directory Disambiguation
**Problem**: Projects might contain multiple directories with cache-like names, but only one contains actual url2md cache data, creating ambiguity in cache selection.
**Solution**: Built cache validation requiring `cache.tsv` file presence and preference system favoring default cache directory names to ensure consistent, predictable cache selection.

### Cache Directory Naming Flexibility vs Recognition
**Problem**: Rigid cache directory naming requirements would force users into specific project structures, but completely flexible naming makes cache detection unreliable.
**Solution**: Adopted content-based detection (requiring `cache.tsv` file) combined with name preference logic to balance flexibility with reliable cache identification.

### Working Directory Independence
**Problem**: Cache detection behavior should be consistent regardless of where users execute commands, but naive implementations fail when executed from subdirectories or cache subdirectories.
**Solution**: Implemented directory-agnostic traversal with proper parent directory detection to ensure cache accessibility regardless of execution location within project structure.

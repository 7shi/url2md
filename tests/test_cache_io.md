# Test Cache I/O Operations

## Why This Implementation Exists

### Challenge of TSV Format Backward Compatibility
**Problem**: Adding new fields to cache data would break existing cache files, forcing users to lose cached data or preventing software updates.
**Solution**: Implemented automatic column padding system that detects missing columns in older TSV files and adds default values, ensuring seamless version migration without data loss.

### Data Serialization Integrity Across Object Lifecycles
**Problem**: Complex URLInfo objects with multiple data types need reliable persistence, but standard serialization can introduce corruption or type inconsistencies.
**Solution**: Adopted TSV-based serialization with explicit field ordering and type preservation to ensure identical data recovery across cache object recreations.

### Empty Field Handling in Structured Data
**Problem**: Optional fields (like error messages) can be empty, but TSV format requires consistent field counts, creating parsing ambiguity between missing and empty values.
**Solution**: Implemented explicit empty string preservation in TSV format to distinguish between missing columns (padding needed) and intentionally empty fields (valid state).

### Cross-Instance Data Consistency
**Problem**: Multiple cache instances or application restarts could lead to data inconsistency if internal state doesn't properly reflect file system state.
**Solution**: Built automatic loading and internal state synchronization to ensure cache instances accurately reflect persisted data without manual intervention.

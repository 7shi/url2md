# Test Cache Translation Integration

## Why This Implementation Exists

### Challenge of Cross-Command Translation State Management
**Problem**: The classify command generates translations that the report command needs, but these are separate processes that don't share memory, requiring persistent translation state management.
**Solution**: Integrated translation cache into main cache system with unified lifecycle management, enabling classify-generated translations to persist for report consumption across separate command executions.

### File System Organization for Multiple Cache Types
**Problem**: URL cache data and translation cache data have different lifecycles and access patterns, but storing them in separate directories would complicate cache management and discovery.
**Solution**: Adopted co-located dual-file approach (`cache.tsv`, `terms.tsv`) within single cache directory to maintain logical separation while simplifying directory management and ensuring atomic operations.

### Translation Cache Lazy Loading Performance
**Problem**: Creating translation cache files on every cache initialization wastes resources when translations aren't needed, but checking file existence on every access adds overhead.
**Solution**: Implemented lazy file creation with automatic loading on cache initialization to minimize resource usage while ensuring translations are available when needed without access overhead.

### Multi-Command Workflow Translation Efficiency
**Problem**: Report generation requires UI term translations, but calling translation APIs during report generation adds latency and costs, while pre-translating all possible terms wastes resources.
**Solution**: Built on-demand translation caching during classify operations with persistent storage, enabling report commands to access pre-translated terms without additional API calls or resource waste.

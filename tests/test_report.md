# Test Report Generation

## Why This Implementation Exists

### Challenge of Multi-Tag URL Classification
**Problem**: URLs can have multiple tags that might match different themes, requiring intelligent classification decisions to avoid arbitrary or inconsistent grouping.
**Solution**: Implemented weighted tag matching algorithm with partial string matching and theme-based scoring to ensure URLs are classified to their most relevant themes consistently.

### URL Organization Within Theme Sections
**Problem**: URLs within a theme need logical grouping, but theme tag order might not reflect URL-specific priorities or create intuitive user navigation.
**Solution**: Adopted URL tag order precedence system where URLs are grouped by their first matching tag, preserving author intent and creating predictable report structure.

### Unclassified Content Management
**Problem**: URLs that don't match any defined themes would be lost or poorly presented in generated reports, reducing content accessibility.
**Solution**: Created dedicated "Unclassified" section with proper statistical tracking to ensure all content remains accessible while highlighting gaps in theme coverage.

### Partial Tag Matching Precision
**Problem**: Exact tag matching is too restrictive (missing related content), while fuzzy matching is unreliable (false associations).
**Solution**: Implemented bidirectional substring matching with length-ratio weighting to capture semantic relationships while maintaining accuracy and consistency.

# Test Report Translation Functionality

## Why This Implementation Exists

### Challenge of Multilingual Report UI Consistency
**Problem**: Users need reports in their preferred languages, but hardcoded English UI terms create poor user experience for non-English speakers and inconsistent localization.
**Solution**: Implemented translation system for UI terms with cache-based efficiency, enabling consistent multilingual report generation while maintaining performance through cached translation lookup.

### Partial Translation Graceful Degradation
**Problem**: Translation coverage might be incomplete for new languages, but failing to generate reports or showing broken UI would render the system unusable.
**Solution**: Built fallback mechanism that uses English for untranslated terms while showing translated terms in target language, ensuring usable reports regardless of translation completeness.

### UI Term vs Content Translation Boundary
**Problem**: Mixing UI term translation with content translation would create expensive, inconsistent results and cache confusion between interface elements and user content.
**Solution**: Established clear separation where only fixed UI terms use translation cache, keeping content translation separate to maintain performance boundaries and logical system organization.

### Cross-Command Translation State Persistence
**Problem**: Report generation needs UI translations that were established during classify operations, but these are separate command executions without shared memory state.
**Solution**: Integrated translation cache with main cache system to persist UI translations across command boundaries, enabling classify-generated translations to be available for report consumption without additional API calls.

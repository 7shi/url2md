# Test Schema Structure

## Why This Implementation Exists

### Challenge of AI Schema Evolution and Validation
**Problem**: AI operations require specific output schemas, but changing requirements would break existing code without compile-time validation, and manual schema management becomes error-prone at scale.
**Solution**: Implemented Pydantic-based schema system with code-based field definitions to provide type safety and IDE support while enabling dynamic adaptation for different AI operation requirements and multilingual scenarios.

### Centralized Architecture Compliance Verification
**Problem**: Distributed command implementations would duplicate CLI logic and create maintenance complexity, but ensuring architectural compliance requires systematic validation of code structure.
**Solution**: Built static analysis testing to verify centralized command architecture where main.py handles all routing while command modules provide pure functions, preventing architectural drift and maintaining clean separation of concerns.

### Package Deployment Configuration Integrity
**Problem**: Missing or incorrect package configuration would break installation or runtime functionality, but configuration errors often go undetected until deployment failures occur.
**Solution**: Established automated validation of pyproject.toml configuration including entry points, dependencies, and licensing to ensure consistent deployability and prevent runtime configuration issues.

### API Surface Stability for Integrations
**Problem**: Changes to public APIs would break external integrations and user scripts, but manual API verification is inconsistent and error-prone across development iterations.
**Solution**: Implemented systematic API structure testing that verifies critical classes and functions remain available with consistent interfaces, protecting external integrations while enabling internal refactoring.

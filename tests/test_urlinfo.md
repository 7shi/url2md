# Test URLInfo Module

## Why This Implementation Exists

### Challenge of URL-Based Content Identification
**Problem**: URLs can be extremely long and contain special characters that make them unsuitable as filenames or identifiers, but content needs consistent identification across system operations.
**Solution**: Implemented MD5 hash generation from URLs to create stable, filesystem-safe identifiers while preserving original URL information for user reference and functionality.

### Domain-Based Request Management
**Problem**: URL analysis operations need domain-level grouping for throttling and organization, but extracting domains from URLs requires handling various URL formats and edge cases.
**Solution**: Built robust domain extraction with case normalization and error handling to provide consistent domain identification for request management and user organization features.

### TSV Serialization Data Integrity
**Problem**: URLInfo objects contain complex metadata that must survive file storage cycles without corruption, but simple serialization approaches fail with special characters in URLs and error messages.
**Solution**: Adopted TSV format with character sanitization and round-trip validation to ensure data integrity while maintaining human-readable cache files and cross-platform compatibility.

### Flexible Input Source Management
**Problem**: Users need to provide URLs from various sources (files, stdin, command line), but each source has different parsing requirements and error handling needs.
**Solution**: Implemented unified URL loading system with source-specific handling (file parsing with comments, stdin streaming, whitespace normalization) to provide consistent user experience regardless of input method.

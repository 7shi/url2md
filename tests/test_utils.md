# Test HTML Utils

## Why This Implementation Exists

### Challenge of JavaScript and CSS Interference
**Problem**: Raw HTML content includes JavaScript and CSS that interferes with content analysis and creates security risks when processing unknown web content.
**Solution**: Implemented selective content filtering that removes script and style tags while preserving semantic HTML structure, ensuring clean content for AI analysis.

### Real-World HTML Variation Handling
**Problem**: Web content has inconsistent HTML formatting - mixed case tags, missing body elements, malformed structures - causing parser failures and content loss.
**Solution**: Adopted case-insensitive regex processing with graceful fallback behavior to handle real-world HTML variations without losing content accessibility.

### HTML Entity and Special Character Processing
**Problem**: HTML entities and special characters in titles and content break text processing and create encoding issues in downstream analysis.
**Solution**: Built entity decoding and whitespace normalization to ensure consistent text representation while preserving semantic meaning.

### Robust Error Recovery for Malformed Content
**Problem**: Invalid or None inputs cause HTML processing to crash, interrupting the entire URL analysis workflow.
**Solution**: Implemented graceful error handling with appropriate fallback values (original input, empty strings) to maintain workflow stability regardless of input quality.

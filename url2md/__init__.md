# Package Initialization Module

## Why This Implementation Exists

### Curated Public API Design
**Problem**: Python packages need clear public APIs while balancing convenience imports against performance and dependency loading.
**Solution**: Defines curated public API through selective imports and explicit `__all__` declaration, importing lightweight utilities and data models while keeping function modules as explicit submodule imports.

### Performance-Conscious Import Strategy
**Problem**: Heavy computational modules slow down basic package imports when users only need core utilities.
**Solution**: Selective auto-import for core utilities (URLInfo, Cache, HTML processing) while computational modules (fetch, summarize, classify) remain available via submodule imports.

### Clear API Boundaries
**Problem**: Package users need to understand what functionality is immediately available versus what requires explicit imports.
**Solution**: `__all__` explicitly defines public interface while maintaining clear access paths to specialized functionality through documented submodule imports.

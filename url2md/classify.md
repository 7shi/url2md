# Classification Module

## Why This Implementation Exists

### Need for Frequency-Based Tag Filtering
**Problem**: Raw tag extraction from URLs produced too many singleton tags that were not meaningful for theme classification, creating noise in the categorization process.
**Solution**: Implemented frequency-based filtering that focuses on tags appearing multiple times across URLs, improving theme classification accuracy by eliminating irrelevant one-off tags.

### Automated Theme Classification with AI
**Problem**: Manual organization of hundreds of tags into meaningful themes was impractical and inconsistent across different content domains.
**Solution**: Integrated LLM-based classification that automatically groups related tags into coherent themes with descriptive names and explanations, enabling scalable content organization.

### Multi-Language Translation Cache Integration
**Problem**: Classification operations needed to support multiple output languages for report generation, but translation calls were expensive and slow.
**Solution**: Built translation cache integration that automatically handles UI term translations during classification, enabling efficient multi-language report generation without duplicating classification logic.

## Why This Implementation Exists

### Dynamic Content Rendering Support
**Problem**: Modern web applications rely heavily on JavaScript to render content, making traditional HTTP requests insufficient for content analysis as they miss dynamically generated content.
**Solution**: Provides Playwright-based dynamic rendering with headless Chromium to execute JavaScript and wait for network idle state before extracting content.

### Intelligent Content Type Handling
**Problem**: Mixed content types (text vs binary) require different processing strategies, and determining the right approach for each URL is complex.
**Solution**: Dual content strategy uses full page content for text types and direct response body for binary, with content type intelligence that distinguishes text formats from binary content.

### Optional Dependency Management
**Problem**: Heavy browser automation dependencies shouldn't be required for users who only need basic functionality.
**Solution**: Graceful degradation with availability checks and clear installation guidance, enabling integration with the larger url2md pipeline while maintaining utility for independent use cases.

# Fetch Module

## Why This Implementation Exists

### Intelligent Batch Processing
**Problem**: Batch URL fetching requires balancing efficiency with responsible web scraping practices, while providing clear feedback on progress and handling various failure scenarios.
**Solution**: Implements intelligent batch processing with domain throttling, selective retry logic, and comprehensive progress tracking that filters URLs based on cache status and user intent.

### Domain-Aware Rate Limiting
**Problem**: Rapid requests to the same domain can trigger rate limiting or blocking, but users need efficient batch processing.
**Solution**: Respects rate limits by tracking per-domain request timing while maintaining overall processing efficiency.

### Session-Scoped Error Reporting
**Problem**: Users need clear feedback on current operation results without confusion from historical errors.
**Solution**: Shows error details only for current session, avoiding confusion while providing comprehensive statistical reporting for the active fetch operation.

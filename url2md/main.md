# Main Module

## Why This Implementation Exists

### Centralized Command Architecture
**Problem**: Web content analysis tools typically scatter command-line interfaces across multiple entry points, leading to inconsistent user experience, duplicated code, and maintenance challenges.
**Solution**: Implements centralized command architecture where all subcommands flow through a single entry point with function-based modules, eliminating code duplication and enabling consistent global options.

### Function Module Pattern
**Problem**: Standalone executable modules create import overhead and make workflow composition difficult.
**Solution**: Each subcommand implemented as pure function with local imports, enabling the workflow command to reuse existing handlers programmatically while maintaining clean separation between CLI orchestration and domain logic.

### Fail-Fast Error Handling
**Problem**: Complex CLI applications need clear error visibility during development without masking the root causes of failures.
**Solution**: Exception-based propagation with full stack traces for debugging, allowing natural error flow while providing immediate problem identification.

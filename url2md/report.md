# Report Module

## Why This Implementation Exists

### Need for Flexible URL-to-Theme Classification
**Problem**: URLs needed to be automatically classified into themes based on their content tags, but simple keyword matching was insufficient for accurate categorization.
**Solution**: Implemented weight-based classification algorithm using substring matching and length ratios, enabling accurate theme assignment even with partial tag matches.

### Multi-Language Report Generation
**Problem**: Generated reports needed to support multiple languages while maintaining consistent data structure and formatting.
**Solution**: Integrated translation cache system that automatically translates UI terms while preserving original content, enabling internationalized reports without duplicating generation logic.

### Structured Report Format with Tag Prioritization
**Problem**: Large numbers of URLs needed organized presentation with meaningful groupings and logical ordering.
**Solution**: Developed tag-based subsection system with configurable priority ordering, allowing reports to highlight important URL categories while maintaining comprehensive coverage.

# Schema Module

## Why This Implementation Exists

### Need for Type-Safe AI Schema Management
**Problem**: Previous JSON file-based and dictionary-based schema approaches lacked type safety, IDE support, and runtime validation, making AI operations error-prone and difficult to maintain.
**Solution**: Adopted Pydantic-based schema generation with complete type safety, enabling compile-time validation and full IDE support for all AI operations.

### Consolidation of Schema Definitions
**Problem**: Schema definitions were scattered across multiple modules and formats, creating maintenance overhead and inconsistent patterns.
**Solution**: Centralized all schema creation functions into a single module with consistent API patterns, providing a single source of truth for AI operation schemas.

### Dynamic Multi-Language Support
**Problem**: Hard-coded English descriptions limited international usage and required manual schema modifications for different languages.
**Solution**: Implemented dynamic language parameter support that automatically generates localized field descriptions while maintaining consistent technical structure.

### Runtime Schema Generation for Translation
**Problem**: Translation operations required different schemas based on input terms, impossible with static schema definitions.
**Solution**: Used Pydantic's `create_model` for runtime class generation, creating type-safe schemas dynamically based on translation requirements while maintaining full IDE support.
